1. Python Basics (Foundation)

🔹 Variables, Integers, Floats

Integers → whole numbers (1, 10, -5)

Floats → decimal numbers (3.14, 0.5)

Variables store values so we can reuse them.


🗣️ Python automatically understands data types, so I don’t need to declare them manually.

🔹 Strings

Strings are text: "Hello World"

You can:

concatenate (+)

format (f-strings)

slice and index

use methods like .upper(), .lower(), .replace()



🗣️ Strings are objects in Python, so they come with built-in methods.

2. Data Structures (Very Important)

🔹 Lists

Ordered

Mutable (can change)

Allow duplicates


Example use: storing usernames, scores, files

🗣️ Lists are best when order matters and data needs to change.

🔹 Tuples

Ordered

Immutable (cannot change)

🗣️ Tuples are used when I want data to stay constant.

🔹 Sets

Unordered

No duplicates

🗣️ Sets are powerful for removing duplicates and doing comparisons like intersections.

🔹 Dictionaries

Key–value pairs

Fast lookup

Example:
{ "name": "Dwin", "age": 17 }

🗣️ Dictionaries are used to represent real-world objects.

3. Booleans, Conditionals & Logic

🔹 Booleans

True or False

Used in decision making

🔹 Conditionals (if, elif, else)

Python checks conditions and runs code based on truth

🗣️ Conditionals allow programs to make decisions dynamically.

4. Loops & Iteration

🔹 For Loops

Used to loop through collections

🔹 While Loops

Runs while a condition is true

🗣️ Iteration allows automation instead of repeating code manually.

5. Functions

Functions group reusable logic

Improve readability and maintainability

🗣️ Functions follow the DRY principle — Don't Repeat Yourself.

6. Variable Scope

Local scope → inside a function

Global scope → outside functions

🗣️ Scope controls where variables can be accessed and avoids conflicts.

7. Working with the Operating System (🔥)

🔹 OS Module

Used to:

Get current directory

Navigate folders

Rename files

Automate tasks

🗣️ Python can interact directly with the operating system.

🔹 Paths & Switching Directories

os.getcwd()

os.chdir()

Absolute vs relative paths

🗣️ Correct path handling is crucial for cross-platform compatibility.

8. File Objects (Very Important)

🔹 Reading Files

open()

.read()

.readline()

.readlines()

🔹 Writing Files

Write or append data safely

🗣️ Python handles files as objects, which must be opened and closed properly.


9. Automating Tasks (🔥🔥)
🔹 Renaming Multiple Files

Loop through files

Rename dynamically

🗣️ This is a real-world automation use case that saves hours of manual work.

🔟 CSV Files (MOST IMPORTANT ‼️)

🔹 Reading CSV Files

Use csv module

Read rows as lists or dictionaries

🔹 Writing CSV Files

Export structured data

🗣️ CSV files are widely used for data exchange between systems.

🔹 Parsing Names from CSV → HTML List

Read CSV

Extract columns

Generate <li> elements

🗣️ This shows how Python can connect backend data with frontend output.

11. Dates & Times

datetime module

Work with:

current time

formatting

time differences

🗣️ Handling dates correctly is critical in real-world applications.

12. Versions & Environment (Mention Briefly)

Different Python versions exist

Virtual environments isolate dependencies

🗣️ This prevents dependency conflicts between projects.”

This playlist helped me understand not just Python syntax, but how Python is used in real-world automation, file handling, and data processing.

Final Tip (IMPORTANT)

If you forget something:

Say:
